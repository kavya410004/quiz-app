Natural fibres also consist of polymers (in the case of biologically produced compounds such as cellulose and protein) but they emerge from the textile manufacturing process in a relatively unaltered state. Some man-made fibres too, are derived from naturally occurring polymers. For instance, Rayon and acetate, two of the first man-made fibres ever to be produced, are made of the same cellulose polymers that make up cotton, hemp, flax and the structural fibres of the wood. In the case of rayon and acetate, however, the cellulose is required in a radically altered state (usually from wood pulp operations) and is further modified in order to be regenerated into practical cellulose-based fibres. Rayon and Acetate, therefore, belong to a group of man-made fibres known as regenerated fibres.             Another group of man-made fibres (and by far the larger group) is the synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibres are made of polymers, like polyester, they do not occur naturally but instead that are produced entirely in the chemical plant or laboratory almost always from the byproduct of petroleum and natural gas. These polymers include nylon and polyethene Terephthalate-mentioned above, but they also include many other compounds such as acrylics, the Polyurethanes things and polypropylene. Synthetic fibres can be mass-produced to almost any set of required properties. Millions of tons of Synthetic fibres are produced every year.
